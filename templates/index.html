<p> KeepVid, YouTubeDownloader, pwnyoutube, and equivalents all require you to install softare, enable Java, or add a Bookmarklet. Which is fine if you're using your home PC. But I wanted something which required nothing, and could be used with any browser, device, and platform. After looking around for a while, I found nothing satisfactory.  Input a video URL in this box, and an an attempt will be made to return an .mp4 file. Supported sites are YouTube, and a few others. </p>
